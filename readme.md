# Weather Station

This is a DIY low power, low cost at home weather station.
My plans with this is to learn, experiment and expand my knowledge in different areas. I am by no means an expert and I am merely doing this for fun.

## 3D Printed Parts
The goal for this weather station is to be mostly 3D-Printed to allow easy serviceability, easy part replacement, and a good understanding of the parts that go into this station. **NOTE** Because these parts are 3D printed and not precisely manufactured the readings from this station will not be 100% accurate and they have a high chance of wearing down quickly over time.

The parts we will be desiging and printing are as follows:
 - Anemometer
 - Wind Vane
 - Radiation Shield for temperature & humidity sensor
 - Rain Gauge
